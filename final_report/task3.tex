\section{Task 3}

\subsection{Testing}
In this section we'll be testing type inference. The current codebase only
allows for type inference to work from left to right. Ie. if the code on both
sides of a equality expression is unknown, it's the left hand side, that's the
victor and thus trumphs its type over to the right hand side.\\
The test here shows it quite good. The type on the righthand side is unknown,
but since chr() is on the left hand side the final type is char.


\begin{lstlisting}[style=MLStyle]
program test_task3;

procedure main()
var a : bool;
begin
  a := chr(read()) = read();
  write(a);write("\n");

  // The following is commented out since it would give an error as expected
  // since type inference only works from left to right.
  //a := read() = chr(read());

end;
\end{lstlisting}
