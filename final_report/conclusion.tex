\section{Conclusion}
Using the knowledge of the LL(1) parser (given from the assignment) and that of
yacc, we rewrote the grammar from the given grammar. Using our knowledge of LR
parsers to handle shift/reduce conflicts, we used associativity to handle
reduce/shift conflicts. By testing all of our changes to the parser, we can be
quite certain that it actually works as intended, and even though we didn't do
really structured test cases, we did test quite a lot. We think in the later
parts of the project a more structured testing approach would be better, but we
felt that the tests were quite simple for the parser, and therefore testing of
the already given pal files and our grammarTester script were enough.
