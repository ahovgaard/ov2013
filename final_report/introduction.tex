\section{Introduction}
In this report we will introduce the implementation of various functionality for
the compiler, interpreter, lexer, and parser.
We will have a section for each task, where we will show the implementation/changed code,
talk about the implementation, and afterwards show the testing of the mentioned implementation. 
The tasks, which we have been asked to implement, are 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Task 1: Implement a parser, using yacc, for the paladim language.
  \item Task 2: Implement operators not, or, division, multiplication.
  \item Task 3: Implement type inference and type checking for \verb|new| function.
  \item Task 4: Implement type checking and code generation for indexing in the compiler.
  \item Task 5: Implement call by value semantics for procedures.
\end{itemize}
