\section{Introduction}
The task at hand is to construct a working parser for the language Paladim,
created for the ``Introduction to Compilers''-course (OV) 2013. The tool used is
a parser generator named \texttt{mosmlyac}.\\
In this milestone report we will focus on getting the parser up and running
while e.g. evaluation of boolean expressions will be saved for later.
