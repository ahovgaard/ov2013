\section{Task 5}
The fifth task was to implement call-by-value-result semantics for procedures,
which means that procedures work on a local copy of its arguments, but copy the
values of these back into the given arguments when it returns.\\
\\
This parameter passing strategy is implemented in both the \textsf{Paladim}
interpreter and in the \textsc{Mips} code generator. In the interpreter module,
\verb|TpInterpret.sml|, the \verb|callFun| function was updated in the case when
the function identifier is predefined and the  option return type is
\verb|NONE|, i.e. when the called function is a procedure without a return a
value. A function \verb|updateAll| walks through the lists actual expressiong
arguments and formal arguments, and calls a new function
\verb|updateOuterVtable| on each pair.
