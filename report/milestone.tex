\section{Introduction}
The task at hand is to construct a working parser for the language Paladim,
created for the ``Oversætter''-course 2013. The tool used is a parser generator
named mosmlyac.\\
In this milestone report we will focus on getting the parser up and running
while f.ex. evaluation of boolean expressions will be saved for later.


\section{Parser implementation in mosmlyac}

Our main goal was to create the same language as the LL(1) parser. We started with the grammar, which was given with the 
assignment. We then modified the grammar to conform with mosmlyacc, and also modified certain areas of the grammar that was
giving conflicts(You can see the conflicts we had in the resolving parse conflicts section.).


\section{Resolving parse conflicts}
We fixed the dangling-else ambiguity by making the \texttt{then} and
\texttt{else} symbols right-associative and giving them the same precedence,
i.e. by using the following mosmlyac declaration:

\begin{verbatim}
  %right TThen TElse 
\end{verbatim}
\
We had a shift/reduce conflict with the modified Decs grammar(which you can see in the changes to the paladin grammar section). The
way we solved the problem was to force a reduce over a shift by making Tid and TSemi non associative, which fixed the conflict problem.


\section{Changes to the Paladim grammar}
\begin{lstlisting}
  $Decs$  ->    $Decs$ $Dec$ ; 
  $Decs$  ->    $Dec$ ;
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
  $Decs$    ->   $Dec$ ; $Decs$
  $Decs$   ->    $Dec$ ;
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Testing methodology}
At the current time in the spacetime-continuum we are only able to compile a subset
of the programs included in the \textbf{DATA}-folder. Those programs are:\\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item fibRex.pal
  \item fibWhile.pal
  \item proctest.pal
  \item readtest.pal
  \item shortest.pal
\end{enumerate}

Also whenever we changed something new in the grammar, e.g. modified some precedence for the Expression, we would use our grammar
script which allows us to create the AbSyn syntax tree without it being further processed. This was quite handy since we can actually
test things that aren't implemented yet for the compiler, typecheck, etc. A good example of the usage of the grammar script was
when we had to test the 'or' and 'not' operators. Since the compiler still does not support these operations, we had to use this script
to see if our precedence was correct - which it is.
\\
\\
Whenever we had made some major changes to the parser, we would run all the aforementioned pal files
in interpreter and compile mode to see if everything still works. Before we even started coding the grammar for the parser, we 
saw how the LL(1) parser handled the aforementioned pal files, and since we are building a replacement for the LL(1) parser, our new
parser should at least handle the same files and give the same output as the LL parser. It was therefore fairly easy to see if the parser
tests were correct, regarding the pal files.
